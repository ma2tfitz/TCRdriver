Various utilities for T cell receptor sequencing with multiple in-line barcodes.

**TODO:**
- There is currently no "main" script; check.py just checks the functioning of the modules and needs to be replaced.
- Need to add adapter trim and "trim-to-length" targets.
- Check that barcode removal is working on the right-hand side of merged reads.
- Needs some PEP8 attention.
